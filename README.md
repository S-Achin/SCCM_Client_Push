# SCCM_Client_Push
This is a PowerShell script which can be used to Push SCCM client on multiple systems. the script can be used if the Powershell remoting is not enable in the environment. i have intigrated the Psexec tool in the script as well as one Batch file which can be written with few commands in it for SCCM client installation.
